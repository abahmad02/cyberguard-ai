## Current Capabilities

### What Works Now âœ…
1. **File Analysis**: Upload .class, .jar, or .zip files for basic malware detection
2. **Risk Assessment**: Get HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/SAFE risk classifications
3. **API Integration**: RESTful endpoints for external system integration
4. **Basic Reporting**: JSON responses with confidence scores

### What's Limited ðŸ”„
1. **Feature Set**: Only 14 basic features vs. planned 29+ advanced features
2. **Model Accuracy**: Basic Random Forest vs. optimized ensemble model
3. **File Types**: Limited to Java bytecode files
4. **User Interface**: API-only, no web dashboard
5. **Scale**: Single-file processing only
